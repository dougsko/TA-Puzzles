	<h2>Welcome Puzzle Fans!</h2>
	<p>These are the answers I came up with for the puzzles posed on
	<a
		href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/careers/careers">tripadvisor.com</a>.
	Beware, there are spoilers ahead!</p>

	<h3>Fast Powers Test</h3>
	<blockquote>What is the fastest way to test if an int is a power of
		two?</blockquote>
	<br/>

	<p>The trick to this question is to use a property found when using
	binary representation of numbers.  If a number is a power of two,
	then in binary, it will be represented as a 1, followed by some
	number of zeros.  If you subtract one from a power of two, then its
	binary representation will be all 1's. If you perform a bitwise AND
	operation of n and n-1, and n is a power of two, then the answer
	will always be zero.  The one special edge case is if n itself is
	zero, in which case, we simply return false.</p>
	
	<p>The code below demonstrates this technique using java.  Compile
	and run the application with the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac FastPowers.java
$ java FastPowers &lt;number&gt;
</code></pre>


	<script
src="https://gist.github.com/dougsko/6910d881d2c163c4ebb5.js"></script>

	<h3>Lot's of 0's</h3>
	<blockquote>How many zeros are on the end of n! ?  Assume n is big.
		So n! is REALLY big.</blockquote>
	<br/>

	<p>To solve this question, we will use a divide by 5^x trick.
	We continually divide n by powers of 5.  At each division, we keep a
	running total of the integer value of the quotient.  When the
	quotient is less than 1, we stop and the current cumulative sum
	equals the number of trailing zeros for any n!.</p>

	<p>The code below demonstrates this algorithm in java.  Compile and
	run it with the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac TrailingZeros.java
$ java TrailingZeros &lt;number&gt;
</code></pre>

	<script
src="https://gist.github.com/dougsko/65dd50487feb36f902cd.js"></script>

	<h3>What's Wrong With...</h3>
	<blockquote>...this code?</blockquote>
	<br/>

<pre><code>public static String parity(String msg)
{
	String parityStr = null;
	int n = msg.hashCode();
	switch(n % 2)
	{
	case 0:
		parityStr = "even";
		break;
	case 1:
		parityStr = "odd";
		break;
	}
	return parityStr;
}
</code></pre>

	<p>The problem with the code above is the use of the
	<code>hashCode()</code> method.  The purpose of this method is to
provide a unique integer value for any object.  However, these integer
values are meant to be dstributed evenly across a domain and have
nothing to do with the even or oddness of the object.</p>

	<h3>How Many Combinations?</h3>
	<blockquote>A TripAdvisor Rubik's Cube has owl heads on it, which
		can be misoriented.  How many (times) MORE combinations are
		there of this cube vs. one that has blank stickers?</blockquote>
	<br/>

	<p>This is a tricky one...  According to an anonymous user on 
	<a
		href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100806083427AAfn0Ce">Yahoo
		Answers</a>: 
	</p>
	
	<blockquote>
	There are 20
	mobile pieces: 8 corners and 12 sides. There are 12! ways to arrange
	the 12 sides, and 8! ways to arrange the corners.  In addition, each
	corner can be in 3 orientations, and each side can be in 2
	orientations, so you have to multiply in factors of 3^8 and 2^12.
	Thus, you get (8! * 3^8) * (12! * 2^12) = 5.2 * 1020 possible
	combinations.</blockquote>
	<br/>

	<p>However, only 1 in 12 combos are actually reachable an so we end
	up dividing everything by 12 and the equation looks like this:
	<code>(8! × 3^8) × (12! × 2^12)/12</code>
	</p>

	<p>So if each square has a sticker on it and that sticker can be
	oriented one of 4 ways...</p>
